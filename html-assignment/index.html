        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>From an early age, I have been fascinated by how things work and look. This fascination carried on throughout my education. That is why arts, science, and technology were always my favorite subjects. It is also why after high school I studied at La Cite in graphic design. Followed by a degree in mechanical engineering. I never could seem to make up my mind. Some of my most memorable moments throughout this journey were also related to science and art. I remember winning the eighth-grade science fair for making a primitive yet functional hydraulic prosthesis arm.</p>
        <p>My goals have always been ambitious and geared towards erecting new creations into the world. Leaving my unique touch behind. I would like to own my own design workshop. A space where I could design not only print or interactive media but mechanical and physical objects alike. A dream factory. This is the reason I have chosen to go back to school in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.</p>
